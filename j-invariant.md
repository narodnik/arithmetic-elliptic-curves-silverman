$$ t = q + 1 - \# E(ùîΩ_q) $$
So the characteristic polynomial of frobenius polynomial is
$x¬≤ - tx + q$.
$$ Œ¶_q¬≤ - [t]Œ¶_q + [q] = 0 $$

Let $Œ±$ be that endomorphism so $Œ± ‚àà$ End(E).

If $Œ± ‚â† 0$ then $\# \ker Œ± ‚â§ \deg Œ±$, so $\ker Œ±$ is finite.

We now show that if $Œ± ‚â† 0$ then $\# \ker Œ± = ‚àû$.

For any int $n$ such that $p \nmid n$,
$$ E[n] \cong ‚Ñ§_n √ó ‚Ñ§_n $$
and we represent
$$ Œ¶_q |_{E[n]} : E[n] ‚Üí E[n] $$
since it's an endomorphism that is just restricted to $E[n]$ so we
can represent this as a matrix
$A = \begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d \\
\end{pmatrix}$

So by direct inspection
$$ A_n¬≤ - \textrm{tr}(A_n) ¬∑ A_n + \det(A_n) I = 0 $$
We've shown that
$$ \det(A_n) = \deg Œ¶_q \mod{n} $$
Another calc shows
$$ \textrm{tr}(A_n) = 1 + \det(A_n) - \det(I - A_n) $$
so
$$ \textrm{tr}(A_n) = 1 + q - \deg(\textrm{id} - Œ¶_q) \mod{n} $$
since $\deg(\textrm{id} - Œ¶_q) = \# E(ùîΩ_q) = q + 1 - t$
so
$$A_n¬≤ - [1 + q - (q + 1 - t)]A_n + qI = 0 $$
for 2x2 matrices.
Remember that $A_n$ is a matrix in $E[n]$ so the matrix is defined over mod $n$.

$$ \underbrace{A_n¬≤ - [t] A_n + qI = 0}_{\textrm{representation of } Œ±|_{E[n]}} $$

This means that for any $n$ such that $p \nmid n$ then for all
$P ‚àà E[n]$
$$Œ±(P) = 0 $$
since the set
$$ U_{p \nmid n} E[n] $$
is infinite (the U means union here),
$$ \# \ker(Œ±) = ‚àû $$
contradiction.

Note: $t = \textrm{tr}(A_n)$ $\forall p \nmid n$ so is called the
trace of Frobenius.

# $\deg(Œ± \circ Œ±') = \deg(Œ±) \circ \deg(Œ±')$

$$ E ‚Üí E' ‚Üí E'' $$
by the maps $Œ±', Œ±$.

For simplicity think $E = E' = E''$.

$$ Œ±(x, y) = (R(x), yS(x)) $$
$$ Œ±'(x, y) = (R'(x), yS'(x)) $$

Then $(Œ± \circ Œ±')(x, y)$ has repr:
$$ (R''(x), yS''(x)) = (R(R'(x)), S(R'(x))S'(x)y) $$

So this already satisfies the property of canonical form.
The other property is that both sides don't share a common root
over the algebraic closure.

If $R(R'(x)) = \frac{u''(x)}{v''(x)}$ is a reduced rational function, then
$$ \deg(Œ± \circ Œ±') = \max{\{ \deg u'', \deg v'' \}} $$

Reduced means no common roots over $\bar{K}$.

How do we prove $R(R'(x))$ is reduced? Lets write over $\bar{K}$
$$ R(x) = \frac{ \prod (x - Œ±_i) }{ \prod (x - Œ≤_j) } $$
$$ R'(x) = \frac{ \prod (x - Œ±_i') }{ \prod (x - Œ≤_j') } $$

$$ R(R'(x)) = \frac{ \prod (\frac{ \prod (x - Œ±_i') }{ \prod (x - Œ≤_j') } - Œ±_i) }{ \prod (\frac{ \prod (x - Œ±_i') }{ \prod (x - Œ≤_j') } - Œ≤_j) } $$
if $x‚ÇÄ$ is such that
$$ R'(x‚ÇÄ) = Œ±_i $$
for some $i$.

Then clearly since $a_i ‚â† Œ≤_j$ for all $j$.
$$ R'(x‚ÇÄ) ‚â† Œ≤_j $$

Finally, a direct calculation shows that if
$$ R''(x) = R(R'(x)) = \frac{ u''(x) } { v''(x) } $$
then
$$ \max{\{ \deg u'', \deg v'' \}} = \max{\{ \deg u, \deg v \}} \max{\{ \deg u', \deg v' \}} $$

$$ R = u/v, R'' = u' / v' $$
$$ R(R') = \frac{ u(u'/v') }{v(u'/v')} $$
as rational functions,
$$ \deg u(u'/v') = u \max{ \{ \deg u', \deg v' \} } $$
(remember we are doing composition not multiplication)
$$ R(R'(x)) = \frac{ u''(x) } {v''(x)} $$
and
$$ \max\{ \deg u'', \deg v'' \} = \deg Œ± \deg Œ±' $$
